<span id="id1"></span><h1>Converting from Maya<a class="headerlink" href="#converting-from-maya" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This section talks about how to prepare a Maya model for export, and then
export it. Since exporting is the very last step, the actual instructions for
the export process are last.</p>
<p>__TOC__</p>
<div class="section" id="material-preparation">
<h2>Material Preparation<a class="headerlink" href="#material-preparation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Note: the information in this section is for Panda3D 1.5.0 and beyond. It does
not apply to older versions of Panda3D.</p>
<div class="section" id="basic-texturing">
<h3>Basic Texturing<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-texturing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In order for the Panda3D to correctly export your textures, you must texture
your model in a manner that Panda3D understands. In fact, you have to follow a
fairly strict formula in order for Panda3D to be able to make sense of your
scene.</p>
<p>Teaching how to use Maya is beyond the scope of this manual. We assume that
you already know how to use maya, and especially the hypershade. The only
purpose of this section is to show you what configurations are understood by
Panda3D.</p>
<p>The first step in texturing your model is to apply a
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Phong</span></code> shader. This is the
only kind of shader that Panda3D understands. You can apply a phong shader
using the Maya menus:</p>
<p><img alt="maya-tex-1.jpg" src="../../_images/maya-tex-1.jpg" /></p>
<p>Next, tell maya that you want to control the color of the surface by clicking
the color button:</p>
<p><img alt="maya-tex-2.jpg" src="../../_images/maya-tex-2.jpg" /></p>
<p>Now create a file texture - this will control the color of the surface:</p>
<p><img alt="maya-tex-3.jpg" src="../../_images/maya-tex-3.jpg" /></p>
<p>Set the filename. Once you do this, you will be able to see your texture in
Maya:</p>
<p><img alt="maya-tex-4.jpg" src="../../_images/maya-tex-4.jpg" /></p>
<p>You now have a straightforward textured model that Panda3D can export.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="advanced-texturing">
<h3>Advanced Texturing<a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-texturing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You may wish to use Panda&#8217;s advanced texturing abilities: multitexturing,
normal maps, gloss maps, transparency, or glow maps. To use these features,
you will need to access Maya&#8217;s hypershade editor:</p>
<p><img alt="maya-hypershade.jpg" src="../../_images/maya-hypershade.jpg" /></p>
<p>A straightforwardly textured model will look like this in the hypershade:</p>
<p><img alt="maya-hyper-1.jpg" src="../../_images/maya-hyper-1.jpg" /></p>
<p>To apply a normal map, create another file texture and connect the &#8220;out color&#8221;
of the normal map to the &#8220;normal camera&#8221; input of the phong shader. The normal
map must be a true normal map (you can recognize them by their light blue
color), not a bump map (which are black-and-white.)</p>
<p><img alt="maya-hyper-2.jpg" src="../../_images/maya-hyper-2.jpg" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is a maya button to help you set up a bump map, but what
it creates is not correct for Panda3D. If you use the button, you end up with
the following incorrect configuration. So far as I know, the only way to get
the correct configuration (shown above) is to set it up manually in the
hypershade. The incorrect configuration is:</p>
<p><img alt="maya-hyper-3.jpg" src="../../_images/maya-hyper-3.jpg" /></p>
<p>You may wish for parts of your model to be transparent. This is a little
tricky, because Panda3D understands &#8220;opacity maps,&#8221; and maya understands
&#8220;transparency maps,&#8221; which are opposites of each other. (In an opacity map,
white is opaque, in a transparency map, black is opaque.) To set it up, you
will need to create a reverser-object:</p>
<p><img alt="maya-hyper-4.jpg" src="../../_images/maya-hyper-4.jpg" /></p>
<p>You may also wish to control which areas of the model are glossy, and which
are not. Panda3D calls this a &#8220;gloss map.&#8221; To do this, create a
black-and-white image and connect it to the &#8220;specularColor&#8221; input of the phong
shader. Note that it must be black-and-white, or Panda3D won&#8217;t understand it.</p>
<p><img alt="maya-hyper-5.jpg" src="../../_images/maya-hyper-5.jpg" /></p>
<p>You may also want to create glowing areas on your model. Panda3D calls this a
&#8220;glow map.&#8221; I have also heard it called a &#8220;self-illumination map&#8221; or an
&#8220;incandescence map.&#8221; Create a black-and-white image and connect it to the
&#8220;incandescence&#8221; input of the phong shader:</p>
<p><img alt="maya-hyper-6.jpg" src="../../_images/maya-hyper-6.jpg" /></p>
<p>Creating a glow map will cause those parts of the model which are glowing to
be bright even when the light is dark. However, it will not by itself create a
full-featured bloom effect. To get that, you need to use a bloom filter in
your Panda3D program in conjunction with the glow map. There is a
<a class="reference internal" href="../../samples/glow-filter.html#glow-filter"><span class="std std-ref">sample program</span></a> that demonstrates this process.</p>
<p>Finally, there is plain old multitexturing. Create this structure in the
hypershade, using a &#8220;Layered Texture&#8221; (NOT a &#8220;Layered Shader!&#8221;):</p>
<p><img alt="maya-hyper-8.jpg" src="../../_images/maya-hyper-8.jpg" /></p>
<p>This will cause the two textures to be multiplied, which is the simplest form
of multitexturing. You can also obtain certain other effects by changing the
settings of the Layered Texture, however, this functionality is very
incomplete at this time. For the most part, you can only multiply.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="merging-textures">
<h3>Merging Textures<a class="headerlink" href="#merging-textures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Maya exporter may will try to merge textures. For example, if your model
has an RGB color map, and a black-and-white opacity map, then the exporter
will consider loading them together as a single RGBA texture.</p>
<p>In order to merge two textures, the following rules must be satisfied:</p>
<p>1. Their UV mappings must be identical. 2. Their filenames must have a common
prefix.</p>
<p>By &#8220;common prefix,&#8221; I mean that the files &#8220;house-color.jpg&#8221; and
&#8220;house-opacity.jpg&#8221; can be merged, because they both start with the common
prefix &#8220;house-&#8221;. A common prefix consists of a series of alphanumeric
characters followed by a dash. If you do not want two files merged, use a
different file naming convention.</p>

<div class="section" id="flagging-objects-from-maya">
<h2>Flagging Objects From Maya<a class="headerlink" href="#flagging-objects-from-maya" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Maya exporter is able to automatically flag objects for collisions if the
objects are flagged properly in Maya. There is a
<a class="reference external" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/panda3d/panda3d/master/pandatool/src/mayaprogs/eggImportOptions.mel">MELscript</a>
in the available in the source code that helps flag objects in Maya.</p>
<p>Installation</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Open up maya&#8217;s script editor (Window&gt;General Editors&gt;Script Editor)</li>
<li>Open the script in the editor and execute it (Ctrl+Enter or Script&gt;Execute)</li>
<li>Type &#8220;eggObjectFlags()&#8221; at the script editor and select the text.</li>
<li>Middle mouse drag the selection into your custom shelf.</li>
<li>Optional: go to the shelf editor and give it a custom icon/name</li>
</ol>
<p>Usage</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Select the objects that you want to tag and press the shelf script.</li>
<li>Set the object type by going to the channel box of the object, there should
be a new attribute called Egg Object TypesN.</li>
<li>Set the object type to the desired value.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Running the Exporter<a class="headerlink" href="#running-the-exporter" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Maya&#8217;s exporter can be run from the command prompt or via a graphical panel.
The command line utility is called maya2egg. There are multiple versions of it
corresponding to different versions of maya. For instance, the version to use
for Maya 5.0 is maya2egg5, for 6.0 its maya2egg6 and for 6.5 its maya2egg65.</p>
<p>The following is an example of how to convert a file(maya binary .mb) if using
Maya 6.0 through the command line.</p>
<p><img alt="MayaCommandLineExport.png" src="../../_images/mayacommandlineexport.png" /></p>
<p>The egg file will contain the filenames of the textures. These texture
pathnames will be stored as relative paths, relative to the location of the
egg file. For example, let&#8217;s say that the files are laid out like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">c</span><span class="p">:</span>\<span class="n">My</span> <span class="n">Models</span>\<span class="n">Maya</span> <span class="n">Files</span>\<span class="n">Character</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mb</span>
<span class="n">c</span><span class="p">:</span>\<span class="n">My</span> <span class="n">Models</span>\<span class="n">Egg</span> <span class="n">Files</span>\<span class="n">Character</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">egg</span>
<span class="n">c</span><span class="p">:</span>\<span class="n">My</span> <span class="n">Models</span>\<span class="n">Textures</span>\<span class="n">Character</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">png</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In that case, the command to export the model is:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">c</span><span class="p">:</span>\
<span class="n">cd</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">:</span>\<span class="n">My</span> <span class="n">Models</span>\
<span class="n">maya2egg</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">o</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Egg Files/Character.egg&quot;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Maya Files/Character.mb&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that <a class="reference internal" href="../../programming-with-panda3d/models-and-actors/loading-models.html#loading-models"><span class="std std-ref">Panda Filename Syntax</span></a> uses forward slashes,
even under Windows, and this applies to the exporter as well. After doing this
export, the character egg will contain the following texture reference:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="s2">&quot;../Textures/Character.png&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Again, notice that this pathname is relative to the egg file itself. Many
artists find it convenient to keep everything in the same directory, to avoid
having to think about this. This approach works fine.</p>
<p>The above conversion process will turn the character into a static model.
Models which are rigged (they have bones to help them animate), skinned
(polygons attached to the bones/skeleton), and are animated need to use one of
the following options:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">maya2egg</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">model</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">o</span> <span class="n">eggFileName</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">egg</span> <span class="n">mayaFileName</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mb</span>
<span class="n">maya2egg</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">chan</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">o</span> <span class="n">eggFileName</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">egg</span> <span class="n">mayaFileName</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mb</span>
<span class="n">maya2egg</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">pose</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">o</span> <span class="n">eggFileName</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">egg</span> <span class="n">mayaFileName</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mb</span>
<span class="n">maya2egg</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">both</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">o</span> <span class="n">eggFileName</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">egg</span> <span class="n">mayaFileName</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mb</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The meanings of these
options are:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="5%" />
<col width="95%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>-a model</td>
<td>Save only the skinned and boned model, ready for animation but with no animation attached. This is ideal for models with several event- or interaction-based animations.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>-a chan</td>
<td>Save only the animation data on the current model, but not the model itself. This is ideal applying animations to an already-existing model egg file that is ready to receive animation. A model may have several animation channels applied to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>-a pose</td>
<td>Save the model in the current key position of the animation applied to it. This position must be selected before choosing to export the file. This format does not save the animation.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>-a both</td>
<td>This will export the model and animation out as one file.</td>
</tr>

<p>There are many options to maya2egg. For a complete list, run maya2egg with the

<h2>Using the New Maya2EGG GUI(To be available for Panda3D 1.7.1 or later)<a class="headerlink" href="#using-the-new-maya2egg-gui-to-be-available-for-panda3d-1-7-1-or-later" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Although the command line version of maya2egg (and the additional optimization
utilities such as egg2bam, egg-optchar, work well when used correctly,
typically problems arise from a poor understanding of the command line options
and requirements. This standalone tools application attempts to demystify some
of those options and present them in a way an artist (rather than a
programmer) can better understand. However, the application still requires the
command line programs to be present in order to actually export or process any
eggs or Maya files. Simply put, the application builds the command line
arguments for you and can process multiple files in a sequence (better known
as batch processing). After all, in most game pipelines models and animations
have to be exported multiple times with no changes to their settings after
minor tweaks within the 3D package. It should also be noted this tool
currently only supports the maya2egg exporter, but since the other
optimization tools operate on egg files they can be used with any egg file
that has been correctly exported from any 3D package.</p>
<p>NOTE: The application was developed to work on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.
There are certain differences between how each operating system installs Panda
, and how directory paths are represented. For the rest of this document
Windows conventions are going to be used, because it is the operating system
that the is most familiar. However, if there are significant differences
between how you need to use the app in Linux of OSX the necessary steps can be
provided to ensure the application working correctly.</p>

<p>This application presents two modes for exporting a model or animation from
Maya. Upon opening the application the simple mode is presented show above.
The simple mode tab is intended to do “one-off” or single file exports. It
would be the same thing as typing the exporter command and options each time
you wanted to export a model. To use simple mode follow these few steps:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>-Click the Save button next to the first text box labeled “Egg file to be
written” and navigate to your intended export directory and name you r
file. When you’ve finished this click OK.</p>
<p>-Click the Choose button next to the text box labeled “Maya file to be
exported” and select the .mb file that you would like to export.</p>
<p>-Select the version of Maya you currently have on your system from the
Maya Version drop-down box.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Now, before you click Run Export, you must decide if you want to export any
animation from the file and if so what type. If you simply want a static model
(usually used for props and game levels) select “none” in the Animation box.
This will export only the geometry from your scene, excluding any joints or
key frames. It should be noted that this type of model will not export any
skinning data from Maya. However, it will still have a transform included
which will allow it to be placed in a Panda3D world.</p>
<p>If you want to export a scene with joints and skinning data so that it can
later accept any exported animation select “model “ from Animation box. This
term can be slightly confusing initially, but once you realize we’re talking
about what type of animation (if any) to export the distinction between “none”
and “model” is slightly more clear. Remember, model doesn’t just mean polygon
geometry, it implies that the model has joints and possibly a skin cluster in
the scene file. It is meant to accept animation data from a separate file or
to be animated by the programmer through code.</p>
<p>If you only want to export the animation data from a scene select “chan”. This
will simply write out the key frames of your scene and what joints those key
frames apply to into the egg file. This file is almost always used with a
separate egg file that was egged out with the “model” option.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you want all the geometry, joints, and skinning data exported to
your egg in one file select “both” from the Animation box. This file type is
rarely used, but special cases exist. Most of the time you would want to keep
the animation and geometry data in separate files. This allows you to load
animations on the fly inside the engine without having to load the geometry
data twice. Thus making your game load (and possibly run) faster.</p>
<p>Once you’ve figured out which type of animation you need to export in your egg
file. Click Run Export. A pop-up window will show up and it will start writing
the output from the command line tool that the application launched in the
background. If your scene file does not export correctly, this text will let
you know in most cases. It can be helpful in tracking down problems and be
sure to copy and paste it to text file if things don’t work out so you can
show your programmer or a member of the Panda community where things are going
haywire. Also, since computers in general have not learned to interpret the
intentions of a human without explicit instructions the egg file may not show
up in the game correctly. In short the exporter may write a perfectly good egg
file, but since something wasn’t quite right in your scene file in Maya,
things may not turn out correctly when you Pview or import the egg into your
game. This almost always has to do with the Maya file itself, NOT the
exporter, so be sure to try and diagnose problems inside Maya first. A good
place to start is the Common Problems section of this document. If there’s no
answer there, post on the Panda3D forums. There are a number of experts and
seasoned artists who have probably come across the same problems you have and
can quickly get you back on track.</p>
<p><strong>ADVANCED MODE</strong></p>
<p><a href="#id4"><span class="problematic" id="id5">|Egg\_Gui\_advanced.jpg|</span></a> For viewing the video tutorial click
<a class="reference external" href="http://vimeo.com/11445391">here</a></p>
<p>In the beginning Simple Mode should cover the basics of single file exporting.
However, once you’ve had to load the application a few times and enter the
same settings over and over again, it’s probably time to move on to using the
Advanced Mode Tab.</p>
<p>Aside from allowing you to have greater control over what specifically gets
exported out of a particular Maya scene, this tab allows you to save these
options and settings for later use. Also, since everyone has a different set
of default exporter options and locations the application allows you to save
and load a preferences XML file to load each time the application is launched.</p>
<p>The process for exporting from the Advanced Mode tab is largely the same as
Simple Mode, but with a few wrinkles. First you should choose your Panda
installation directory and Maya version from the Environment Options section.
This location is the directory where you told Panda3D to install when running
the installer. It is NOT the \bin directory where the maya2egg executable
resides. This little wrinkle was necessary to allow multiple operating systems
to use the application.</p>
<p>The last difference between Simple and Advanced mode for exporting a single
file, is that it must be put into the batch list before it can be exported.
The Batch List represents the order of the files that are about to be
exported. To Add a Maya scene file with its export options to this list simply
click Add To Batch (The other utilities in the Extra Utilities section have
this same button for simplicity’s sake, but the main Add To Batch button deals
solely with the maya2egg tool). After you’ve added any number of scene files
with any of the available options to the Batch List you can then click Run
Batch and the application will launch the exporter or utility command one by
one until it has finished the entire list of items.</p>
<p>Another useful feature of the application is that it checks the modified date
of every file used as an input for the given utility (ie the .mb file for an
exporter batch command, and an egg file for egg2bam). This is handy if you
have saved out an entire batch list of 20 files but only need to export the
three files you actually changed. The exporter skips any unchanged files by
default, but this behavior can be overridden by checking the “Override export
changed files” checkbox next to the Run Batch button.</p>

<h3>Using the Egg-Palletize Tool<a class="headerlink" href="#using-the-egg-palletize-tool" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For viewing the video tutorial click <a class="reference external" href="http://vimeo.com/11445357">here</a></p>
<p>Egg-palettize is an optimization tool in Panda for you to group your textures.
You can have your textures placed in a single palette. In the advance mode of
the GUI, choose the egg-palettize panel. This is the egg-palettize Tool.</p>
<p><a href="#id6"><span class="problematic" id="id7">|Pallettize\_1.jpg|</span></a></p>
<p>For using Egg pallettize for a single egg file select that option in the drop
down list</p>
<p><a href="#id8"><span class="problematic" id="id9">|Pallettize\_2.jpg|</span></a></p>
<p>First, specify the input egg file, the output texture file and the output egg
file. The output texture file is where the palette will be put in. And the
output egg file is the new egg with the new palette as the texture. Before
generating the egg palette, a .txa file should be generated with some
attributes listed in the attribute panel. Set palette size: Specify the size
of the palette. Imagetype: Image type of the palette. Powertwo flag: Specifies
whether textures should be forced to a power of two size when they are not
placed within a palette. The default is false.</p>
<p>Set background color: Specifies the background color of the generated palette
images. The background color is the color of the palette images where nothing
is used. The number r, g, b, a channels are range from 0 to 255. The default
color is black.</p>
<p>Margin: This specifies the amount of default margin to apply to all textures
that are placed within a palette image. The margin is a number of additional
pixels that are written around the texture image to help prevent color
bleeding between neighboring images within the same palette. The default is 2.</p>
<p>Coverage: The &#8216;coverage&#8217; of a texture refers to the fraction of the area in
the texture image that is actually used, according to the UV&#8217;s that appear in
the various egg files. If a texture&#8217;s coverage is less than 1, only some of
the texture image is used (and only this part will be written to the palette).
If the coverage is greater than 1, the texture repeats that number of times. A
repeating texture may still be palettized by writing the required number of
copies into the palette image, according to the coverage area. This attribute
specifies the maximum coverage to allow for any texture before rejecting it
from the palette. It may be any floating-point number greater than zero. Set
this to 1 to avoid palettizing repeating textures altogether.</p>
<p>After setting all the attribute, click on Save Attributes button to save all
the attributes to a .txa file. Last, add this to batch list, after clicking
run batch, the palette will be generated.</p>
<p>Egg-palettize for multiple eggs</p>
<p><a href="#id10"><span class="problematic" id="id11">|Pallettize\_3.jpg|</span></a></p>
<p>Egg-palettize can also generate a palette image for multiple egg files to
share. This palette image has all the textures of multiple egg files to be
placed on it. This panel is almost the same as the single egg one. Only for
the input egg file can have multiple egg files put into it. Select a added egg
file and click Remove button can remove that egg file. Click Remove All button
can remove all the added egg files The output is a folder to put all the new
eggs. Attributes Panel is the same as the single egg one.</p>

<h2>Using the Graphical Front-End(Old)<a class="headerlink" href="#using-the-graphical-front-end-old" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As of Panda3D 1.0.4, there is a graphical front-end to maya2egg. To run the
graphical Maya exporter, drag MayaPandaTool.mel from the panda plugins
directory into the Maya workspace.</p>
<p><img alt="MayaPandaToolLoad.png" src="../../_images/mayapandatoolload.png" /></p>
<p>The UI window(below) will appear.</p>
<p><img alt="Maya-exporter.png" src="../../_images/maya-exporter.png" /></p>
<p>You can alternatively load the .mel file from the script editor. To save
space, the graphical tool does not have access to all of the features of the
exporter. It is designed for rapid verification of assets. The features you
can execute with the graphical tool are identical to the respective ones of
the command line exporter listed below.</p>
<p>Or, you can integrate the UI interface to Maya. There is a very convenient way
to launch the MayaPandaTool, using Maya shelf to store the MEL script :</p>
<p>[1] open the Script Editor :</p>
<p>Window &gt; General Editors &gt; Script Editor</p>
<p>[2] In Script Editor, load the MayaPandaTool MEL script :</p>
<p>File &gt; Open Script</p>
<p>[3] select the MEL text (press Ctrl+A)</p>
<p>[4] using middle mouse button, drag the selected text onto the shelf</p>
<p>[5] (optional) using Shelf Editor, you can change the image of Panda exporter
icon to distinguish it from the others. <img alt="LaunchMPT.jpg" src="../../_images/launchmpt.jpg" /></p>
<p>Anytime you need to open the Panda Exporter, just click the icon on the shelf.</p>
<p>For Windows users :</p>
<p>If you want a faster launch, you can put the MEL file on the QuickLaunch.
Press Ctrl while dragging the MEL file onto QuickLaunch bar. If you don&#8217;t
press Ctrl, the actual file dropped to QuickLaunch is only the shortcut to the
MEL file.</p>
<p>Anytime you need to open the Panda exporter, just drag it from QuickLaunch bar
to the 3D window of Maya.</p>
