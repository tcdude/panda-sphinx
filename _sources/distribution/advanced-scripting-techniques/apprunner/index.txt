AppRunner
=========

AppRunner is the Python class that supervises the launching of your
application in a p3d file. There is a global instance of AppRunner available
in base.appRunner whenever your application is running as a p3d file. In fact,
this is a reliable way to test your run mode:



.. code-block:: python
    
    if base.appRunner:
        print "Running in a p3d file"
    else:
        print "Running interactively"



All of your interaction with the web environment will go through
