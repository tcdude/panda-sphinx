Distributing Panda3D Applications
=================================

Beginning in Panda3D version 1.7.0, Panda provides a packaging and
distribution system designed to make it very easy to distribute your Panda3D
application to the world, either embedded within a web page or distributed as
a standalone application.

If you are using an older version of Panda3D or do not wish to use the
packaging and distribution system that Panda3D provides for whatever reason
then you can use
`packpanda <https://www.panda3d.org/manual/index.php/Building_an_installer_using_packpanda>`__
or any other similar tool for Python/C++ programs.
