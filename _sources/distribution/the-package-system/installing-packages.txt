Installing packages
===================

A package file is a Panda3D multifile. When a package is installed onto a
user's machine, it means the multifile is downloaded and placed in its own
subdirectory of the Panda3D installation directory (e.g.
~/Library/Caches/Panda3d, on Mac). This directory name is then stored in the
environment variable PACKAGENAME\_ROOT, where PACKAGENAME is the name of the
package converted to uppercase, e.g. PANDA3D\_ROOT or ODE\_ROOT. (You can
query this environment variable name at runtime with
ExecutionEnvironment.getEnvironmentVariable('PANDA3D\_ROOT').)

The multifile is also automatically "mounted" using Panda's VirtualFileSystem,
onto the same directory, so that it is as if all of the contents of the
multifile are actually available as individual files within the
PACKAGENAME\_ROOT directory, even though the individual files may not actually
appear on disk at all. Furthermore, the PACKAGENAME\_ROOT directory is added
to Python's sys.path, as well as to Panda's model-path, so that any Python
modules can be imported, and any model files can be imported, directly from
the package. In addition, any prc files in the PACKAGENAME\_ROOT directory
will be automatically loaded.

Some file types, such as DLL files, really do need to be extracted to disk to
be used, because they are loaded directly by the operating system and not by
Panda. These files are extracted automatically when the package is installed
and left within the PACKAGENAME\_ROOT directory (or within a subdirectory if
the filename so indicates).
