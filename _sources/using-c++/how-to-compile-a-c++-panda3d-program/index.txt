How to compile a C++ Panda3D program
====================================



.. only:: python

    This page is related to C++ usage of Panda3D and not to Python usage. If you
    are a Python user, please skip this page. For C++ users, please toggle to the
    C++ version of this page.




.. only:: c++

    This short guide explains how to compile and run a Panda3D game written in
    C++. If you use Python for your Panda3D programs, you can skip this section.
    
    On UNIX, it is a very good possibility that you can compile using the g++
    compiler. The following page describes how to do that:
    
    -  :ref:`Linux version <how-to-compile-a-c++-panda3d-program-on-linux>`
    -  :ref:`Mac OS X version <how-to-compile-a-c++-panda3d-program-on-mac-os-x>`
    
    On Windows, compiling using g++ will not work. It is however possible to
    compile your Panda3D project using the MSVC (Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 C++)
    compiler. The following page describes how to do that:
    
    -  :ref:`MSVC version <how-to-build-a-c++-panda3d-game-using-microsoft-visual-studio-2008>`
