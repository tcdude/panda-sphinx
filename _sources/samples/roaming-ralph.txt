Sample Programs: Roaming Ralph
==============================

The Roaming Ralph Sample Program

To run a sample program, you need to install Panda3D. If you're a Windows
user, you'll find the sample programs in your start menu. If you're a Linux
user, you'll find the sample programs in /usr/share/panda3d.

Explanation

This tutorial shows a character walking on uneven terrain. He rises and falls
with the contours of the terrain, stops when he runs into a tree or a rock,
and won't walk off the edge. The camera follows him, also moving intelligently
over the terrain, and you have some control over the camera angle. The
character's body animates sensibly according to his motion.

Much of this is implemented using collision rays to detect the height of the
terrain and the presence of obstacles.

Caution: this program uses an extremely inefficient method for detecting the
height of the terrain. There is a much better way to do it, but we have not
had time to correct the sample program. Back to the List of Sample Programs:
