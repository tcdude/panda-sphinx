Third-party dependencies and license info
=========================================

License Info
------------

While Panda3D itself uses the Modified BSD license, it brings together many
third-party libraries released under different licenses. This page provides
information on the different libraries and their licenses. Panda3D builds with
some of these libraries by default, however, some of them are linked only into
plug-ins that can be easily removed from the distribution.

Disclaimer
----------

Panda3D takes no responsibility for any act committed using the information
presented here. For legal advice, it is recommended to consult a lawyer.

Building Panda3D
----------------

When building Panda3D yourself on your computer you'll notice that
makepanda.py looks up if you have some libraries installed. On operating
systems with a packaging system, like most GNU/Linux distros have, you'll most
likely find all dependencies as packages in the official repositories.
Otherwise you have to take care of the libraries yourself.

Here you have a list of all third party libraries Panda3D must or can be
compiled against. All of them are optional, but some features of Panda3D
depend on certain libraries being available; omitting certain libraries will
omit the corresponding features from Panda3D.

Recommended Libraries
---------------------

Python
~~~~~~

http://www.python.org/

Panda3D is way easier and faster to code with when using Python bindings.

libjpeg
~~~~~~~

http://www.ijg.org

JPEG library. Required to read and save JPEG files. As of Panda 1.10, Panda
will fall back to stb\_image for loading .jpg files when building without
libjpeg, but this may not support all JPEG features.

License: libjpeg license

libpng
~~~~~~

http://www.libpng.org

Portable Network Graphics library. Required to read and save PNG files. As of
Panda 1.10, Panda will fall back to stb\_image for loading .png files when
building without libpng, but this may not support all PNG features.

OpenSSL
~~~~~~~

http://www.openssl.org

Provides some networking and encryption support. Required for HTTPClient, and

this library, however, Panda can use static fonts stored in egg files, as
generated by the tool egg-mkfont (however, the tool egg-mkfont itself requires
Freetype).

License: `FreeType License <http://freetype.sourceforge.net/FTL.TXT>`__ or
`GPL <http://freetype.sourceforge.net/GPL.TXT>`__

License note: To distribute under a proprietary license, FreeType License must
be chosen instead of GPLv2. Use of FreeType must be acknowledged in product
documentation.

GTK2
~~~~

The Gimp ToolKit is used by only by the PStats server on non-Windows
platforms. This is a separate utility that can easily be deleted and is only

libsquish
~~~~~~~~~

http://code.google.com/p/libsquish/

Libsquish gives DXT support. This improves Panda's support for pre-compressed
texture images such as dds files, and it allows Panda to streamline
compression of textures images at load time. However, even without this
library, Panda can still compress and use compressed textures, by relying on
the interfaces built into your graphics driver.

Patent Restriction Issues
-------------------------

MP3
~~~

MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 (MP3), while commonly used, is recommended against. The
format has patent and licensing issues in many countries. Unlicensed use of
MP3 runs the risk of infringing in these countries.
`Licensing <http://mp3licensing.com/royalty/games.html>`__ the use of MP3
costs at minimum royalties of US$2500 per title for games and $15000 per
calendar year for other software.

MPEG
~~~~

Other MPEG related formats are restricted by
`patents <http://www.mpegla.com/main/default.aspx>`__ as well. Finding the
prices of licenses for these formats is not even as easy as it is with MP3.
More info
`here <http://bemasc.net/wordpress/2010/02/02/no-you-cant-do-that-with-h264/>`__.

Recommended Alternatives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Free alternatives exist and are highly encouraged. These formats include `Ogg
Vorbis <http://www.vorbis.com>`__ (lossy) and `Ogg
FLAC <http://flac.sourceforge.net>`__ (lossless) for audio, and `Ogg
Theora <http://www.theora.org>`__ for video.
