Physics
=======

Panda3D offers four built-in choices to use for Physics:

-  :ref:`Panda's Built-in Physics Engine <panda3d-physics-engine>`: Panda3D
   has a very basic physics engine built-in that may apply forces to classes.
   The physics engine can handle angular or linear forces, as well as
   viscosity.
-  :ref:`The Open Dynamics Engine <ode>`: This is a more extended physics
   engine that Panda3D offers good integration for, you will want to use this
   if you need more complex physics simulations. In Panda3D versions 1.5.3 and
   above, this is integrated in the binaries from the download page.
-  NVIDIA PhysX: New in 1.7.0. Not yet documented.
-  \ `Bullet Physics
   Engine <https://www.panda3d.org/manual/index.php/Using_Bullet_with_Panda3D>`__\ :
   New in 1.8.0.

When you have a very simple simulation, you will most likely want to use the
built-in physics, which works with Panda's collision system. Although, when
the built-in engine doesn't offer enough functionality for you, you can switch
to ODE, Bullet or PhysX.

Integration for various other physics engines have been provided by the
community on the forums:
