Using Bullet with Panda3D
=========================

Bullet is a modern and open source physics engine used in many games or
simulations. Bullet can be compiled on many platforms, among them Windows,
Linux and MacOSX. Bullet features include collision detection, rigid body
dynamics, soft body dynamics and a kinematic character controller.

This section is about how to use the Panda3D Bullet module.

All Bullet classes are prefixed with "Bullet". A list of all classes and their
methods can be found within the `API
reference <https://www.panda3d.org/reference/python/namespace!panda3d.bullet>`__.
However, the class and function descriptions are still missing.

Note:The Panda3D Bullet module makes great effort to integrate Bullet physics
as tightly as reasonably possible with the core Panda3D classes. However, when
implementing collision detection and physics, you can not mix Bullet's
internal physics & collision system, ODE, PhysX and Bullet. More explicitly:
Bullet bodies won't collide with ODE bodies and CollisionNodes.

Samples on how to use the Panda3D Bullet module can be found in the following
