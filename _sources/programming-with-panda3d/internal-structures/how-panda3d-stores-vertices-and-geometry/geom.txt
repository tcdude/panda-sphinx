Geom
====

The Geom object collects together a :ref:`geomvertexdata` and one or more
:ref:`geomprimitive` objects, to make a single renderable piece of geometry.
In fact, an individual Geom is the smallest piece into which Panda will
subdivide the scene for rendering; in any given frame, either an entire Geom
is rendered, or none of it is.

Fundamentally, a Geom is very simple; it contains a pointer to a single
GeomVertexData, and a list of one or more GeomPrimitives, of various types, as
needed. All the associated GeomPrimitives index into the same GeomVertexData.

The GeomVertexData pointer may be unique to each Geom, or one GeomVertexData
may be shared among many different Geoms (each of which might use a different
subset of its vertices). Also, although the GeomPrimitive objects are usually
unique to each Geom, they may also be shared between different Geoms.

Although a Geom can have any number of GeomPrimitives associated with it, all
of the GeomPrimitives must be of the same fundamental primitive type:
triangles, lines, or points. A particular Geom might have GeomTriangles,
GeomTristrips, and GeomTrifans; or it might have GeomLines and GeomLinestrips;
or it might have GeomPoints. But no one Geom can have primitives from two
different fundamental types. You can call geom.getPrimitiveType() to determine
the fundamental primitive type stored within a particular Geom.
