How Panda3D Stores Vertices and Geometry
========================================

This section describes the structure and interconnections of Panda3D's
internal vertex and geometry data objects, in general terms. You should read
through this section carefully, so that you have a good understanding of
Panda3D's data structures, before attempting to read the section about
generating procedural data.
