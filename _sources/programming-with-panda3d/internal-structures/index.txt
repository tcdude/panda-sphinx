Advanced operations with Panda3D's internal structures
======================================================

The following pages provide descriptions of Panda's internal representation of
vertices and the renderable geometry that uses them, as well as instructions
for directly reading or manipulating this data.

This is an advanced topic of Panda3D and is not necessary for ordinary model
rendering and animation, but the advanced user may find this information
useful.
