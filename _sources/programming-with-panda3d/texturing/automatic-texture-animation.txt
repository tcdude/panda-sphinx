Automatic Texture Animation
===========================

It's possible to generate a model that automatically rotates through a
sequence of textures when it is in the scene graph, without having to run a
special task to handle this.

To do this, use the ``egg-texture-cards``
command-line utility. This program will accept a number of texture filenames
on the command line, and output an egg file that rotates through each texture
at the specified frame rate:

::
    
    egg-texture-cards -o flip.egg -fps 30 explosion*.jpg



This actually creates a model with a different polygon for each frame of the
texture animation. Each polygon is put in a separate node, and all the nodes
are made a child of a special node called a
``SequenceNode``.

The SequenceNode is a special node that only draws one of its children at a
time, and it rotates through the list of children at a particular frame rate.
You can parent the model under render and it will automatically start
animating through its textures. If you need it to start at a particular frame,
use something like this:



.. code-block:: python
    
    flip = loader.loadModel('flip.egg')
    flip.find('**/+SequenceNode').node().pose(startFrame)
    flip.reparentTo(render)



By default, all of the polygons created by
``egg-texture-cards`` will have the same
size. This means that all of your textures must be the same size as well.
While this is a simple configuration, it may not be ideal for certain effects.
For instance, to animate an explosion, which starts small and grows larger, it
would be better to use a small texture image on a small polygon when the image
is small, and have a larger image on a larger polygon when it grows larger.
You can achieve this effect, with the -p parameter; specifying -p scales each
frame's polygon in relation to the size of the corresponding texture.

    egg-texture-cards -o flip.egg -fps 30 -p 240,240 explosion*.jpg



There are several other parameters as well;
``use egg-texture-cards -h`` for a complete list.
