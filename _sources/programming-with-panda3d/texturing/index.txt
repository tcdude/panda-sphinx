Texturing
=========

At its simplest, texturing merely consists of applying a texture in your
modeling program. When you export the model, the path to the texture and some
options for it like filtering or repeat-method (see next pages) are saved into
the egg file. The texture paths can be either relative (as seen from the egg
file) or absolute (full path). See :ref:`loading-models` for more info about
Panda's Filename Syntax. In most cases the relative path makes more sense.

Panda can load JPG, PNG, TIF, and a number of other file formats.

More advanced texturing methods are described in the following sections.
