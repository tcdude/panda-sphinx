The Shader Generator
====================

The Shader Generator
--------------------


As of version 1.5.0, panda supports several new features:

-  per-pixel lighting
-  normal mapping
-  gloss mapping
-  glow mapping
-  high-dynamic range rendering
-  cartoon shading

It's not that these things weren't possible before: they were. But previously,
you had to write shaders to accomplish these things. This is no longer
necessary. As of version 1.5.0, all that has to happen is for the artist to
apply a normal map, gloss map, or glow map in the 3D modeling program. Then,
the programmer gives permission for shader generation, and Panda3D handles the
rest.

A few of these features do require minimal involvement from the programmer:
for instance, high-dynamic range rendering requires the programmer to choose a
tone-mapping operator from a small set of options. But that's it: the amount
of work required of the programmer is vastly less than before.

Many of these features are complementary with
:ref:`image postprocessing operations <common-image-filters>`, some of which
are now nearly-automatic as well. For example, HDR combines very nicely with
the bloom filter, and cartoon shading goes very well with cartoon inking.

Individually, these features are not documented in this chapter of the manual.
Instead, they're documented in the portion of the manual where they make the
most sense. For example, normal mapping, gloss mapping, and glow mapping are
all documented in the section on :ref:`texturing`. HDR and cartoon shading are
documented under Render Attributes in the subsection on :ref:`light-ramps`.

However, to enable any of these features, you need to tell Panda3D that it's
OK to automatically generate shaders and send them to the video card. The call
to do this is:



.. only:: python

    
    
    .. code-block:: python
        
        nodepath.setShaderAuto()
    
    




.. only:: c++

    
    
    .. code-block:: cpp
        
        nodepath.set_shader_auto();
    
    


If you don't do this, none of the features listed above will have any effect.
Panda will simply ignore normal maps, HDR, and so forth if shader generation
is not enabled. It would be reasonable to enable shader generation for the
entire game, using this call:



.. only:: python

    
    
    .. code-block:: python
        
        render.setShaderAuto()
    
    




.. only:: c++

    
    
    .. code-block:: cpp
        
        window->get_render().set_shader_auto();
    
    


Sample Programs
---------------


Three of the sample programs demonstrate the shader generator in action:

-  :ref:`cartoon-shader`
-  :ref:`glow-filter`
-  :ref:`bump-mapping`
-  :ref:`shadows`

In each case, the sample program provides two versions: Basic and Advanced.
The Basic version relies on the shader generator to make everything automatic.
The Advanced version involves writing shaders explicitly.

Per-Pixel Lighting
------------------


Simply turning on ``setShaderAuto``
causes one immediate change: all lighting calculations are done per-pixel
instead of per-vertex. This means that models do not have to be highly
tesselated in order to get nice-looking spotlights or specular highlights.

Of course, the real magic of
``setShaderAuto`` is that it enables you
to use powerful features like normal maps and the like.

Known Limitations
-----------------


The shader generator replaces the fixed-function pipeline with a shader. To
make this work, we have to duplicate the functionality of the entire fixed
function pipeline. That's a lot of stuff. We haven't implemented all of it
yet. Here's what's supported: (as of version 1.7.0)

-  flat colors, vertex colors and color scales
-  lighting
-  normal maps
-  gloss maps
-  glow maps
-  materials, but not updates to materials
-  1D, 2D, 3D, cube textures
-  most texture stage and combine modes
-  light ramps (for cartoon shading)
-  some texgen modes
-  texmatrix


Here's what's known to be missing:

-  some texgen modes
-  fog (added in Panda3D 1.8.0)


These functions are high on the list of priorities, and will probably be
coming sometime in the next month or so.

Note that although vertex colors are supported by the ShaderGenerator, in
order to render vertex colors you need to apply a
``ColorAttrib.makeVertex()`` attrib to the render
state. One easy way to do this is to call
``NodePath.setColorOff()``(that is, turn off
scene graph color, and let vertex color be visible). In the fixed-function
renderer, vertex colors will render with or without this attrib, so you might
not notice if you fail to apply it. Models that come in via the egg loader
should have this attribute applied already. However, if you are using your own
model loader or generating models procedurally you will need to set it
yourself.

How the Shader Generator Works
------------------------------


When panda goes to render something marked
``setShaderAuto``, it synthesizes a
shader to render that object. In order to generate the shader, it examines all
the attributes of the object: the lights, the material, the fog setting, the
color, the vertex colors... almost everything. It takes into account all of
these factors when generating the shader. For instance, if the object has a
material attrib, then material color support is inserted into the shader. If
the object has lights, then lighting calculations are inserted into the
shader. If the object has vertex colors, then the shader is made to use those.

Caching and the Shader Generator
--------------------------------


If two objects are rendered using the same RenderState (ie, the exact same
attributes), then the shader is only generated once. But even a single change
to the RenderState will cause the shader to be regenerated. This is not
entirely cheap. Making changes to the RenderState of an object should be
avoided when shader generation is enabled, because this necessitates
regeneration of the shader.

A few alterations don't count as RenderState modifications: in particular,
changing the positions and colors of the lights doesn't count as a change to
the RenderState, and therefore, does not require shader regeneration. This can
be useful: if you just want to tint an object, apply a light to it then change
the color of the light.

There is a second level of caching. If the system generates a shader, it will
then compare that shader to the other shaders it has generated previously. If
it matches a previously-generated shader, it will not need to compile the
shader again.

So, to save the full cost, use the same RenderState. To save most of the cost,
use two RenderStates that are similar. By "similar," I mean having the same
general structure: ie, two models that both have a texture and a normal map,
and both have no vertex colors and neither has a material applied.

Combining Automatic Shaders with Manual Shaders
-----------------------------------------------


Sometimes, you will want to write most of a game using panda's automatic
shader generation abilitites, but you'll want to use a few of your own
shaders. A typical example would be a scene with some houses, trees, and a
pond. You can probably do the houses and trees using panda's built-in
abilities. However, Panda doesn't contain anything that particularly looks
like pond-water: for that, you'll probably need to write your own shader.

When you use ``render.setShaderAuto()``, that
propagates down the scene graph just like any other render attribute. If you
assign a specific shader to a node using
``nodepath.setShader(myshader)``, that overrides any
shader assignment propagated down from above, including an Auto shader
assignment from above. So that means it is easy, in the example above, to
enable auto shader generation for the scene as a whole, and then override that
at the pond-nodepath.

Creating your own Shader Generator
----------------------------------


We anticipate that people who are writing full-fledged commercial games using
Panda3D might want to write their own shader generators. In this way, you can
get any effect you imagine without having to give up the convenience and
elegance of being able to simply apply a normal map or a gloss map to a model,
and having it "just work."

To create your own shader generator, you will need to delve into Panda3D's C++
code. Class ShaderGenerator is meant to be subclassed, and a hook function is
provided to enable you to turn on your own generator.
