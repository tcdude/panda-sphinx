Common Image Filters
====================



.. only:: c++

    Note: Sorry, but the CommonFilters and FilterManager classes are implemented
    in Python and will not be of much use to C++ users.


Common Image Filters
--------------------


Note: the following information applies to Panda version 1.5.0 and beyond. It
does not apply to older versions of Panda3D.

The purpose of class CommonFilters is to make it easy to set up a number of
common image postprocessing operations.

Import the class like this:



.. code-block:: python
    
    from direct.filter.CommonFilters import CommonFilters



Currently, the image postprocessing operations supported by class
CommonFilters is:

#. Bloom Filter - creates a glowing halo around bright objects.
#. Cartoon Inker - draws black lines around 3D objects.
#. Volumetric Lighting - screen-space method for casting god-rays (new in
   1.6.0)
#. Inverted Filter - inverts all colors (new in 1.6.0)
#. Blur/Sharpen Filter - applies a generic blur or sharpen filter (new in
   1.7.0)
#. Ambient Occlusion - applies a screen-space ambient occlusion filter (new in
   1.7.0)

We expect this list to grow rather substantially over the next year or so.

Basic Setup
-----------


The first step is to create an object of class CommonFilters. Pass in a
pointer to your window, and your 3D camera:



.. code-block:: python
    
    filters = CommonFilters(base.win, base.cam)



This will have no effect until you enable a filter (instructions below.) Once
a filter is enabled, class CommonFilters will reconfigure the Panda3D
rendering as follows:

-  It will render the scene into an offscreen buffer, using the camera you
   provided.
-  It will remove the scene from the specified window, and replace it with a
   fullscreen quad.
-  The quad will be textured with the scene, plus a shader that implements
   whatever filter you have selected.

If all goes well, the net effect is that your scene will continue to appear in
your window, but it will be filtered as you specify.

What if the Video Card can't handle it?
---------------------------------------


If the video card is not capable of implementing your filters, then all
filters will be removed and the filter-enabling function will return False.
Otherwise, filter-enabling functions will return True.

The Bloom Filter
----------------


The bloom filter causes bright objects to have a glowing halo around them. To
enable a bloom filter, use
``setBloom``. To disable, use
``delBloom``:



.. code-block:: python
    
    filters.setBloom( ... options ...)
    filters.delBloom()



The bloom filter works as follows. First, it renders the scene into a texture.
It also asks the renderer to render any glow-maps into the alpha channel of
the texture. After rendering the scene, it generates a second copy of the
scene which has been darkened until only the brightest pixels are visible, and
all the others go to black. It then blurs that texture, yielding soft halos
where the bright pixels used to be, and black everywhere else. It then adds
the soft halos back onto the scene in the window.

Note: If you want to use glow maps to indicate which parts of the image should
receive bloom, you should assign a nonzero value to the alpha value of the
blend-weight parameter, and you should enable the
:ref:`shader generator <the-shader-generator>` for the models that have glow
maps applied.

The bloom filter has many keyword parameters:

-  blend - The bloom filter needs to measure the brightness of each pixel. It
   does this by weighting the R,G,B, and A components. Default weights:
   (0.3,0.4,0.3,0.0). You should assign a nonzero weight to the alpha channel
   if you want the glow map to have an effect, or a value like (0, 0, 0, 1) if
   you only want your glow map to indicate which models should glow.

-  mintrigger - Minimum brightness at which a halo is generated. Default: 0.6

-  maxtrigger - Maximum brightness at which the halo reaches peak intensity.
   Default: 1.0

-  desat - Degree to which the halo is desaturated. Setting this to zero means
   the halo is the same color as the bright pixel. Setting it to one means the
   halo is white. Default: 0.6

-  intensity - An adjustment parameter for the brightness of the halos.
   Default: 1.0

-  size - Adjusts the size of the halos. Takes a string value: "small",
   "medium", or "large". The reason that this is a discrete value and not a
   continuous one is that the blur operation involves downsampling the
   original texture by a power of two. Default: "medium"

The Cartoon Inking Filter
-------------------------


The cartoon inking filter causes objects to have black lines around them. To
enable a cartoon inking filter, use
``setCartoonInk``. To disable, use
``delCartoonInk``:



.. code-block:: python
    
    filters.setCartoonInk( ... options ...)
    filters.delCartoonInk()



The cartoon inking filter works by rendering a camera-space normal into an
texture. Then, a postprocessing filter does an edge-detect algorithm on the
camera-space normal texture.

The filter has the following keyword parameters:

-  separation - Distance in pixels, controls the width of the ink line.
   Default: 1 pixel.

-  color - Color of the outline (new in 1.8.0). Default: (0, 0, 0, 1)

The Volumetric Lighting Filter
------------------------------


The Volumetric Lighting filter makes objects cast visible light rays (also
known as crepuscular rays, god rays or sunbeams) that can be occluded by
visible geometry. This is an easy way to easily create nice-looking light/sun
effects.



.. code-block:: python
    
    filters.setVolumetricLighting( ... options ...)
    filters.delVolumetricLighting()



The filter has the following keyword parameters:

-  caster - NodePath that indicates the origin of the rays. Usually, you would
   pass your light, and create a sun billboard which is reparented to the
   light's NodePath.

-  numsamples - Number of samples. The more samples you use, the slower the
   effect will be, but you will have smoother light rays. Note that using a
   fuzzy billboarded dot instead of a hard-edged sphere as light caster can
   help with smoothing the end result, too. This value does not need to be a
   power-of-two, it can be any positive number. Default: 32

-  density - This defines the length of the rays. The default value of 5.0 is
   probably too high for many purposes, usually a value between 0.5 and 1.0
   works best. This also depends on the number of samples and exposure you've
   chosen, though. Default: 5.0

-  decay - Decay makes rays gradually decrease in brightness. The default
   value of 0.1 is not well chosen and makes the rays very short! Usually,
   this a value close to 1.0, like 0.98. Default: 0.1

-  exposure - Defines the brightness of the rays. Default: 0.1

The Inverted Filter
-------------------


This filter simply inverts the colors of the image.



.. code-block:: python
    
    filters.setInverted()
    filters.delInverted()



This filter has no parameters.

The Blur / Sharpen Filter
-------------------------


This filter can apply a blur or sharpen effect to the image.



.. code-block:: python
    
    filters.setBlurSharpen( ... options ...)
    filters.delBlurSharpen()



The filter has the following keyword parameters:

-  amount - The amount of blurring, this is usually a value between 0.0 and
   2.0. You can take values smaller than 0.0 or larger than 2.0, but this
   usually gives ugly artifacts. A value of 0.0 means maximum blur. A value of
   1.0 does nothing, and if you go past 1.0, the image will be sharpened
   instead of blurred. Default: 0.0

The Ambient Occlusion Filter
----------------------------


This filter adds a simple screen-space ambient occlusion effect to the scene.



.. code-block:: python
    
    filters.setAmbientOcclusion( ... options ...)
    filters.delAmbientOcclusion()



It is important that the viewing frustrum's near and far values fit the scene
as tightly as possible. Note that you need to do lots of tweaking to the
parameters to get this filter to work for your particular situation.

The filter has the following keyword parameters:

-  numsamples - The amount of samples used. Default: 16

-  radius - The sampling radius of the rotating kernel. Default: 0.05

-  amount - Default: 2.0

-  strength - Default: 0.01

-  falloff - Default: 0.000002
