Polygon Occluder Culling
========================

Polygon Occluders
=================

Introduction
------------

One method of occlusion culling is to explicitly define a shape which will
block out objects behind it. This is called a Polygon Occluder and is
represented in Panda by the OccluderNode.

Creating an OccluderNode
------------------------

An occluder is defined by four vertices. The order of the vertices is
important as this defines which way the normal of the polygon is facing.


.. code-block:: python
    
    occluder = OccluderNode('my occluder', Point3(0, 0, 0), Point3(1, 0, 0), Point3(1, 1, 0), Point3(0, 1, 0))
    occluder_nodepath = render.attachNewNode(occluder)
    render.setOccluder(occluder_nodepath)

It is hidden by
default, but can be shown for debug purposes using the show method on its
NodePath. The occluder only needs to be parented into the scene if you want to
show it, or if it needs to move with an object in the scene. Use the
setOccluder method on any NodePath to make the occluder active on that
NodePath and its children. It is much more efficient to call setOccluder on a
parent node with children as opposed to calling setOccluder on many different
nodes.

Occluder Configuration
----------------------

Besides the shape of the occluder, there are other settings which affect how
the occluder behaves. Use the setDoubleSided method on the OccluderNode to
enable the occluder to work on both sides. This is desirable for example if
the occluder is placed inside of a wall. A double-sided occluder is more
efficient than creating two occluders with opposite normals. Use the
setMinCoverage method to ignore an occluder that doesn't take up at least a
certain amount of screen space.

General Occluder Advice
-----------------------

More is not always better. Occluders do have a cost, so use them sparingly
where they will make the biggest difference. If you have a lot of occluders,
it might help to evaluate your occluders every once in a while and only use
the closest ones. The optimal amount and configuration of occluders depends on
the makeup of your scene. Test different configurations and compare the frame
rates.
