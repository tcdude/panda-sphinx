Collision Solids
================

The CollisionSolid is the fundamental object of the collision system.
CollisionSolids represent special invisible geometry that is created solely
for the purpose of performing collision tests; these CollisionSolids are
stored in the scene graph alongside the normal visible geometry.

The CollisionSolids are specifically optimized for performing collision tests
quickly. Collisions can be performed against visible geometry as well, but
this is more expensive since visible geometry is not optimized for this sort
of thing.

You can create CollisionSolids interactively in program code, or you can
construct them in your modeling package and load them up from an egg or bam
file along with the rest of your scene.

When you create a CollisionSolid interactively, you must also create a
CollisionNode to hold the solid. (When you load your CollisionSolids in from
an egg file, the CollisionNodes are created for you.) Often, a CollisionNode
will be used to hold only one solid, but in fact a CollisionNode can contain
any number of solids, and this is sometimes a useful optimization, especially
if you have several solids that always move together as a unit.



.. only:: python

    
    
    .. code-block:: python
        
        cs = CollisionSphere(0, 0, 0, 1)
        cnodePath = avatar.attachNewNode(CollisionNode('cnode'))
        cnodePath.node().addSolid(cs)
    
    




.. only:: c++

    
    
    .. code-block:: cpp
        
        PT(CollisionSphere) cs = new CollisionSphere();
        cSphere_node= new CollisionNode("Sphere");
        cSphere_node->add_solid(cs);
    
    


CollisionNodes are hidden by default, but they may be shown for debugging
purposes:



.. only:: python

    
    
    .. code-block:: python
        
        cnodePath.show()
    
    




.. only:: c++

    
    
    .. code-block:: cpp
        
        cSphere_node->show();
    
    


Note: Be aware that the collision algorithm has only limited awareness of
scaling transforms applied to CollisionSolids. This particularly applies to
non-uniform scales, ie. when the X, Y and Z components of a scale transform
are not all the same. If unequal scaling is applied between a "from" collider
and an "into" collider, unexpected results may occur. In general, strive to
have as few scaling transforms applied to your collision solids as possible.

There are several kinds of CollisionSolids available.

CollisionSphere
---------------

The sphere is the workhorse of the collision system. Spheres are the fastest
primitives for any collision calculation; and the sphere calculation is
particularly robust. If your object is even vaguely spherical, consider
wrapping a sphere around it.

Also, a sphere is a particularly good choice for use as a "from" object,
because a sphere can reliably be tested for collision with most of the other
solid types. The "from" objects are the objects that are considered the active
objects in the world; see :ref:`collision-traversers`. A sphere is usually the
best choice to put around the player's avatar, for instance. The sphere also
makes a good "into" object; it is the only object type that is a good choice
for both "from" and "into" objects.

A sphere is defined in terms of a center and a radius. Note that, like any
object, the sphere's coordinates are defined in the sphere's own coordinate
space, so that often the center is (0, 0, 0).



.. code-block:: python
    
    sphere = CollisionSphere(cx, cy, cz, radius)



CollisionTube
-------------

A "tube" is a cylinder with hemispherical endcaps. This shape is sometimes
called a capsule in other collision systems.

The tube is good as an "into" object, for objects that are largely
cylindrical. It is not a very good choice for a "from" object, because not
many intersection tests have been written from tubes into other shapes.

|A CollisionTube|

A tube is defined with its two endpoints, and the cylindrical radius.



.. code-block:: python
    
    tube = CollisionTube(ax, ay, az, bx, by, bz, radius)



CollisionInvSphere
------------------

The inverse sphere is a special-purpose solid that is rarely used, but
occasionally it is very useful. It is an inside-out sphere: the solid part of
the sphere is on the outside. Any object that is on the outside of the sphere
is considered to be colliding with it; any object on the inside is not
colliding.

Think of the inverse sphere as a solid mass that fills the whole universe in
all directions, except for a bubble of space in the middle. It's useful for
constraining an object within a particular space, since nothing can get out of
an inverse sphere.



.. code-block:: python
    
    inv = CollisionInvSphere(cx, cy, cz, radius)



CollisionPlane
--------------

The CollisionPlane is an infinite plane extending in all directions. It is not
often used, but it can be useful in certain cases, for instance as a trigger
placed below the ground to detect when an avatar has accidentally slipped
through a crack in the world. You can also build a box out of six planes to
keep objects perfectly constrained within a rectangular region, similar to an
inverse sphere; such a box is much more reliable than one constructed of six
polygons.

The plane actually divides the universe into two spaces: the space behind the
plane, which is all considered solid, and the space in front of the plane,
which is all empty. Thus, if an object is anywhere behind a plane, no matter
how far, it is considered to be intersecting the plane.

Although it can only be used as an "into" solid, it is the most reliable of
the "into" solids; tests are implemented for every "from" solid, and since it
extends out infinitely, there is no possibility of glitching through it. This
makes it an excellent choice for a ground plane in games where the ground is
mostly level.

A CollisionPlane is constructed using a Panda3D Plane object, which itself has
a number of constructors, including the A, B, C, D plane equation, or a list
of three points, or a point and a normal.



.. code-block:: python
    
    plane = CollisionPlane(Plane(Vec3(0, 0, 1), Point3(0, 0, 0)))



CollisionPolygon
----------------

A CollisionPolygon is the most general of the collision solids, since it is
easy to model any shape with polygons (especially using a modeling package).
However, it is also the most expensive solid, and the least robust--there may
be numerical inaccuracies with polygons that allow collisions to slip through
where they shouldn't.

Like a plane and a tube, a CollisionPolygon is only a good choice as an "into"
object. It doesn't support collision tests as a "from" object.

In general, if you must use CollisionPolygons to model your shape, you should
use as few polygons as possible. Use quads instead of triangles if possible,
since two triangles take twice as much time to compute as a single quad. This
does mean that you need to ensure that your quads are perfectly coplanar.

You can also make higher-order polygons like five-sided and six-sided polygons
or more, but you cannot make concave polygons. If you create a concave or
non-coplanar CollisionPolygon in your modeling package, Panda will
automatically triangulate it for you (but this might result in a suboptimal
representation, so it is usually better to subdivide a concave polygon by
hand).

Unlike a plane, a CollisionPolygon is infinitely thin; an object is only
considered to be colliding with the polygon while it is overlapping it.

When you create a CollisionPolygon interactively, you can only create
triangles or quads (the higher-order polygons can only be loaded from an egg
file). Simply specify the three or four points to the constructor, in
counter-clockwise order.



.. code-block:: python
    
    quad = CollisionPolygon(Point3(0, 0, 0), Point3(0, 0, 1),
      Point3(0, 1, 1), Point3(0, 1, 0))



CollisionRay
------------

The ray is a special collision solid that is useful only as a "from" object;
since the object has no volume, nothing will collide "into" a ray. The same is
true for line, parabola, and segment listed below.

The CollisionRay represents an infinite ray that begins at a specific point,
and stretches in one direction to infinity.

It is particularly useful for picking objects from the screen, since you can
create a ray that starts at the camera's point of view and extends into the
screen, and then determine which objects that ray is intersecting. (In fact,
there is a method on CollisionRay called
``setFromLens()`` that automatically sets
up the ray based on a 2-d onscreen coordinate; this is used by the "picker".
See :ref:`clicking-on-3d-objects`.)

The CollisionRay is also useful in conjunction with the CollisionHandlerFloor;
see :ref:`collision-handlers`.

A CollisionRay is created by specifing an origin point, and a direction
vector. The direction vector need not be normalized.



.. code-block:: python
    
    ray = CollisionRay(ox, oy, oz, dx, dy, dz)



CollisionLine
-------------

This is essentially the same as a CollisionRay, except it extends to infinity
in both directions. It is constructed with the same parameters, an origin
point and a direction vector.



.. code-block:: python
    
    line = CollisionLine(ox, oy, oz, dx, dy, dz)



CollisionSegment
----------------

A segment is another variant on the CollisionRay that does not extend to
infinity, but only goes to a certain point and stops. It is useful when you
want to put a limit on how far the CollisionRay would otherwise reach.

A CollisionSegment is constructed by specifying the two end points.



.. code-block:: python
    
    segment = CollisionSegment(ax, ay, az, bx, by, bz)



CollisionParabola
-----------------

A parabola is another variant on the CollisionRay that bends. It is useful
when you want to test with arcs, such as a cannonball shot.

CollisionBox
------------

Finally, a box represents a cuboid. It consists of three pairs of rectangles,
with adjacent sides meeting each other at a right angle. This can be employed
where ever a necessity arises for using six intersecting planes. A box can be
both a 'from' and 'into' object for the shapes specified in the chart. A box
can only be constructed as an Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB). That is, each
side of the box is parallel to one of the coordinate axes. Once constructed,
all collision tests are performed on the box as though it was an
Oriented-Bounding Box (OBB).

There are two constructors for the Box. One of them specifies the center for
the box as well as the distance of each of the sides from the center.



.. code-block:: python
    
    box = CollisionBox(center, dx, dy, dz)



The second form of constructor takes the two diagonally opposite end points of
the AABB. 

.. code-block:: python
    
    box = CollisionBox(Point3(minx,miny,minz),Point3(maxx,maxy,maxz))



Collision System Chart
----------------------

Here is a table of the Collision Solids that can be used as "from" and "into"
objects in a Collision.

At noted above, with no volume CollisionRay, CollisionLine, CollisionParabola,
CollisionSegment are only "from", never "into" and hence not listed as columns
in the table below.

At present, CollisionFloorMesh, CollisionInvSphere, CollisionPlane, and
CollisionPolygon are only "into" and never "from" and hence are not listed as
rows in the table below.

In the table below, the solid is listed without its "Collision" preface, e.g.,
"Sphere" instead of "CollisionSphere", to save on space.
