Panda3D Rendering Process
=========================

The rendering process in Panda is comprised by four classes and their
interactions: GraphicsPipe, GraphicsEngine, GraphicsStateGaurdian, and
GraphicsOutput. The following sections will explain the purpose of each of
these classes in detail.

Note that the following interfaces are for the advanced user only. If you are
writing a simple application that only needs to open a window and perform
basic 3-D rendering, there is no need to use any of these interfaces, as the
appropriate calls to open a default window are made automatically when you
``import direct.directbase.DirectStart`` at the start of your
application.

At some point, however, you may wish to understand more deeply how to manage
your windows and buffers, and to do this it will help you to understand how
everything is connected together.
