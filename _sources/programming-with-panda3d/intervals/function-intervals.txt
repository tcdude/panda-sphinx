Function Intervals
==================



.. only:: python

    Function intervals are different from function lerp intervals. While the
    function lerp interval passes data to a function over a period of time, a
    function interval will simply execute a function when called. As such, a
    function interval’s use really appears when combined with sequences and
    parallels. The function interval’s format is simple.
    
    
    
    .. code-block:: python
        
        intervalName = Func(myFunction)
    
    
    
    You pass the function without parentheses (i.e. you pass
    ``Func``- a function pointer)
    as the parameter. If ``myFunction``
    takes arguments, then pass them as parameters to
    ``Func`` as follows:
    
    
    
    .. code-block:: python
        
        def myFunction(arg1, arg2):
           # Do something.
        
        intervalName = Func(myFunction, arg1, arg2)
    
    
    
    Functions cannot be called on their own in sequences and parallels, so it is
    necessary to wrap them in an interval in order to call them. Since function
    intervals have no duration, they complete the moment they are called.

    As FunctionInterval is implemented in Python, this section does not apply to
    C++.
