Artificial Intelligence (PANDAI)
================================

Panda3D is currently integrated with the AI library called PandAI v1.0.

PandAI is a simple AI library for Panda3D which provides functionality to
create 'Artificially Intelligent' behavior in NPC (Non-Playable Characters) in
games.

The PandAI library provides functionality for :

1. Steering Behaviors :

Seek, Flee, Pursue, Evade, Wander, Flock, Obstacle Avoidance, Path Following

2. Path Finding :

This section is devoted to intelligently avoiding obstacles via the shortest
path (calculated via the A\* algorithm with Binary Heap optimizations). Its
functionality and limitations are explained in more detail in its own section.
