Audio Managers
==============

Sound effects and music in code are implemented as
``AudioManager`` objects. You can access
these audio managers with the following code:



.. code-block:: python
    
    sfxMgr = base.sfxManagerList[0]
    musicMgr = base.musicManager



In ``base``,
``sfxManagerList`` is a list of
``AudioManager`` objects intended to be
used for sound effects, and
``musicManager`` is an
``AudioManager`` object intended to be
used for music.

Each ``AudioManager`` object can have 16
different sounds cached at a given time. This value is actually set as the
``audio-cache-limit`` in the panda config.prc
(found in your install directory) and can be changed.

There are times where either sound effects, music, or both should be disabled
and later enabled. These commands affect entire categories of sounds. Passing
True or False in the last 2 functions will disable or enable the respective
groups.



.. code-block:: python
    
    base.disableAllAudio()
    base.enableAllAudio()
    base.enableMusic(True)
    base.enableSoundEffects(True)



Positional audio is implemented through a wrapper of these objects and is
covered in the next section, :ref:`3d-audio`.
