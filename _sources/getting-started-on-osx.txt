Getting Started on OSX
======================

Congratulations! You've installed Panda3D on your machine. Now, what next?

First of all, you should :ref:`prepare <preparation>` by learning Python. You
can also use C++ with Panda3D, but since most of its users use Python, and it
is a very easy language to master, Python is the most recommended choice.

Then, you can dive into the :ref:`Manual <>` and try the Hello World samples.
The manual is a great resource for learning Panda3D and getting in-depth
information about various subjects. However, for more concrete examples, you
can dive into the :ref:`Sample Programs <samples>`, which ship with the
Panda3D build.

Running the Sample Programs
---------------------------

Panda3D comes with a handful of Sample Programs, which are stored in
/Developer/Examples/Panda3D (for Panda3D 1.6.x, they are stored in
/Applications/Panda3D/1.6.0/samples). After opening a terminal window navigate
to the directory of the sample program you want to see.

Then, you can run the program by using the 'ppython' command: (For Panda3D
1.6.x, use '/usr/bin/python' rather than 'ppython')


.. code-block:: python
    
    ppython Tut-Asteroids.py



Troubleshooting Common Issues
-----------------------------

What to do if you see the Error Message:
::
    
    dyld: Library not loaded: @executable_path/../Library/Frameworks/Cg.framework/Cg
    Referenced from: /Applications/Panda3D/1.6.0/lib/libpanda.dylib
    Reason: image not found
    Trace/BPT trap



This means you need to download and install the `NVIDIA Cg
Toolkit <http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cg_toolkit.html#downloads>`__
before you will be able to use Panda3D.

What to do if you see the Error Message:
::
    
    Fatal Python error: Interpreter not initialized (version mismatch?)
    Abort trap

Or the following:
::
    
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "main.py", line 1, in <module>
        import direct.directbase.DirectStart
    ImportError: No module named direct.directbase.DirectStart



You are running a version of Python that is not compatible with the version
Panda3D has been compiled with. However, OSX always ships with a system
version of Python that should be compatible. The fact that it doesn't work
simply indicates that the wrong copy of python is ran.

You need to make sure you are running Apple's version of Python. Fortunately,
Panda3D ships with a file called 'ppython' that is a mere symlink to
/usr/bin/python, where Apple's copy of Python resides. So, instead of
'python', you should call 'ppython'.

What to do if you see the Error Message:
::
    
    display(error): The application requested hardware acceleration, but your OpenGL
    display(error): driver, GDI Generic, only supports software rendering.
    display(error): You need to install a hardware-accelerated OpenGL driver, or,
    display(error): if you actually *want* to use a software renderer, then
    display(error): alter the hardware/software configuration in your Config.prc file.
    display(error): Window wouldn't open; abandoning window.



This error is fairly self-explanatory: it means your video drivers are
inadequate. Obtain updated drivers by running Software Update or, if you have
installed a 3rd party video card, installing new drivers from the video card
vendor.

Alternatively, you can use Panda3D in software rendering mode, You will not be
able to use fancy shaders and it will be much slower than in hardware mode.
However, if you still want to use it, you need to edit your Config.prc file
(which can be found in the "etc" dir of your Panda3D installation) and find
this line: ::
    
    load-display pandagl

Replace that
line with this instead: ::
    
    load-display tinydisplay
