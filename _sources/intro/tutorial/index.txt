A Panda3D Hello World Tutorial
==============================

This tutorial is called "A Panda Hello World". It is a typical example of a
simple Panda3D program. Walking through this tutorial will enable you to
obtain some limited familiarity with the Panda3D API without having to learn
the entire thing. The program that we are going to create will load up a small
scene containing some grass and a panda. The panda will be animated to walk
back and forth over the grass.
