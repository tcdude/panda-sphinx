<h2>Modern Performance Tuning Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#modern-performance-tuning-introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Inexperienced game programmers, when they see that their programs are running
slow, often react by trying to reduce the number of polygons. This almost
never makes any difference whatsoever. Back in the mid-90&#8217;s, reducing polygon
counts was a reasonable strategy to make games faster. That strategy just
doesn&#8217;t work any more. The reason for this is that video card manufacturers
have been increasing the polygon limits of their video cards by leaps and
bounds. In fact, they&#8217;ve raised the polygon limit so high that you almost
never hit that limit any more: you usually hit some other limit first.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the key to modern performance tuning: knowing all the limits of the
machine other than the polygon limit, and figuring out which of those
limitations you&#8217;ve run into. In other words, the key to modern performance
tuning is diagnosis.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="most-common-problem-silly-little-bugs">
<h2>Most Common Problem: Silly Little Bugs<a class="headerlink" href="#most-common-problem-silly-little-bugs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When people start performance tuning, they often start with the assumption
that there&#8217;s something serious wrong with the engine, or the design of the
game. In my experience, however, 90% of the time the problem is that the game
contains a silly (but destructive) bug. Here are some examples of bugs that I
have seen:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A game had a text readout in the corner of the screen, which got updated
every frame. But they updated the text by creating a new text object, and
forgot to remove the old text object. So the corner of the screen contained
thousands of layers of accumulated messages.</li>
<li>A shooter allowed you to fire bullets from your gun. But they forgot to
remove the bullet after it collided with a wall. As a result, the bullets
just kept going through the wall, and into outer space. Every bullet you or
anyone else had ever fired was still flying through space, and the
animation system was working like crazy to animate tens of thousands of
bullets.</li>
<li>Think of another example here.</li>
</ul>
<p>I cannot emphasize this too much: do not redesign your game, until you are
sure that the problem isn&#8217;t a typo! Imagine how irritated you would be if you
wrote an MMO, and then spent six months re-engineering it to make it faster,
only to discover that the entire performance problem was an off-by-one error
in a minor subroutine.</p>
<p>Catching performance problems that are bugs can be tricky. The place to begin
is using the same performance diagnostics that you would use for any other
problem. However, you will usually find a red flag somewhere: if the
performance monitoring tools say that you&#8217;re rendering 50,000 models, but you
only count 50 models on the screen, you&#8217;re dealing with a bug. You need to be
alert enough not to discount such red flags. If you see a stat that looks
suspicious, don&#8217;t assume that the performance monitoring tool is telling you
the wrong thing &#8212; assume that there&#8217;s a bug in the code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-fast-should-it-run">
<h2>How Fast Should it Run?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-fast-should-it-run" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of the things that makes performance tuning difficult is that you need to
find things that are running slower than they &#8220;should&#8221; - but how do you know
how fast something &#8220;should&#8221; run? Experienced game programmers have a gut feel
for what their video card should be capable of, but inexperienced ones often
don&#8217;t really know what to expect. This makes performance tuning that much
harder.</p>
<p>However, you have an advantage. We have a collection of
<a class="reference internal" href="../samples/index.html#samples"><span class="std std-ref">sample programs</span></a> demonstrating Panda3D features. It is easy to
turn on the frame-rate meter to see how fast these samples run. The
screenshots in the manual contain frame-rates, taken with a Radeon x700. That
should give you a baseline. It is even more informative to turn on the
frame-rate meter to see what your video card can deliver.</p>
<p>Video Synchronisation</p>
<p>Panda3D sometimes caps the framerate to not exceed the monitor&#8217;s refresh rate:
this is called video synchronization. Panda3D knows that since the monitor
can&#8217;t refresh faster (the monitor refresh rate is usually between 60 and 85
Hz), everything above that rate is wasted, so Panda3D will not refresh faster
than the monitor&#8217;s refresh rate. To disable this and be able to see the &#8216;true&#8217;
framerate, set the config variable
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sync-video</span></code> to
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#f</span></code> in your
<a class="reference internal" href="../programming-with-panda3d/the-configuration-file/configuring-panda3d.html#configuring-panda3d"><span class="std std-ref">Config.prc</span></a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="list-of-common-performance-issues">
<h2>List of Common Performance Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#list-of-common-performance-issues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Here is a list of things that can go wrong, roughly in order from most likely
to least likely. Each of these has a section to explain it in greater detail.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference internal" href="too-many-meshes.html#too-many-meshes"><span class="std std-ref">Performance Issue: Too Many Meshes</span></a>. A well-made typical 3D model contains one mesh.
Huge 3D models, such as the model of an entire dungeon or an entire island,
might contain multiple meshes. 3D models created by inexperienced modelers
can contain dozens of meshes. Most video cards can render about 300 meshes
total for the entire scene. Panda3D contains tools to coalesce multiple
meshes into one, but they aren&#8217;t fully automatic.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="too-many-state-changes.html#too-many-state-changes"><span class="std std-ref">Performance Issue: Too Many State Changes</span></a>. The state of an object is the sum of its
color, material, light, fog, and other attributes. It can be expensive, for
a variety of reasons, to have too many different states in your scene. It
is better if many objects share the same state.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="too-many-text-updates.html#too-many-text-updates"><span class="std std-ref">Performance Issue: Too Many Text Updates</span></a>. If you have lots of text in your game that
gets updated every frame, it will often take a long time for Panda to keep
regenerating the text. You need to minimize the amount of text to
regenerate per frame.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="too-many-shader-instructions.html#too-many-shader-instructions"><span class="std std-ref">Performance Issue: Too Many Pixel Shader Instructions</span></a>.
If you are using per-pixel lighting, or hand-written shaders, you need to
be conscious of how long your shaders are. Adding one pixel shader
instruction can slow the video card a lot. Adding a texture lookup can slow
it even more. Professional pixel shaders contain 20-30 assembly-level
instructions.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="excessive-fill.html#excessive-fill"><span class="std std-ref">Performance Issue: Excessive Fill</span></a>. The fill rate of the video card is number of pixels
it can render per second. Objects that are occluded (behind other objects)
still consume fill rate. The total fill-consumption of</li>
</ul>
<p>the scene is the total screen real estate of all objects, including the
occluded ones. Particles, in particular, can consume fill-rate like crazy,
especially if the camera gets close to the particles.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference internal" href="memory-full.html#memory-full"><span class="std std-ref">Performance Issue: Memory Full</span></a>. A floating point-number takes four bytes. Just one
vertex contains (X,Y,Z), and a normal, and a texture coordinate. An RGBA
color takes four bytes, so a 1024x1024 texture is four megabytes. Do the
math, and you&#8217;ll see how fast it all adds up.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="python-calculation.html#python-calculation"><span class="std std-ref">Performance Issue: Python Calculation</span></a>. Python is a very slow</li>
</ul>
<p>language. Most Panda3D programs only run a few thousand lines of python per
frame, since all the real work is done in C++. Sometimes, though, you need to
do some complex calculation, and Panda3D just doesn&#8217;t contain any C++ code to
do it for you. In that case, trying to write the calculation in python can
cause problems. You may need a C++ plug-in.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference internal" href="failure-to-garbage-collect.html#failure-to-garbage-collect"><span class="std std-ref">Performance Issue: Failure to Garbage Collect</span></a>. It&#8217;s easy</li>
</ul>
<p>to get used to the fact that Python&#8217;s garbage collector can automatically
clean up Panda3D data structures. Unfortunately, there are a few structures
that can&#8217;t be cleaned up automatically. You need to know what they are, or you
may end up with a leak.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference internal" href="collision-system-misuse.html#collision-system-misuse"><span class="std std-ref">Performance Issue: Collision System Misuse</span></a>. The collision</li>
</ul>
<p>system can detect most types of collisions very rapidly. However, it is
possible to construct situations that the collision detection system just
can&#8217;t handle. Know what it&#8217;s good at, and what it&#8217;s not.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference internal" href="motherboard-integrated-video.html#motherboard-integrated-video"><span class="std std-ref">Performance Issue: Motherboard Integrated Video</span></a>. Motherboard</li>
</ul>
<p>video is very misleading. The chips have names like &#8220;Radeon&#8221; and &#8220;GeForce&#8221;
that we have come to associate with speed, but these chips are an order of
magnitude slower than real video cards. Programming for these chips requires
special consideration.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference internal" href="too-many-polygons.html#too-many-polygons"><span class="std std-ref">Performance Issue: Too Many Polygons</span></a>. This is at the bottom of the likelihood list, but
it can still happen. Usually this happens in combination with something
else, e.g. if you have a large vertex shader, performance can be
drastically reduced for each vertex you add.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="miscellaneous.html#miscellaneous"><span class="std std-ref">Performance Issue: Miscellaneous</span></a>. There are a lot of small things that have a
surprisingly large impact on performance. For instance, printing messages
on the console can be very slow in Windows. This section lists a number of
miscellaneous things that can bog you down.</li>
</ul>
