<div class="section" id="panda3d-basics">
<h2>Panda3D Basics<a class="headerlink" href="#panda3d-basics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Panda3D is a 3D engine: a library of subroutines for 3D rendering and game
development. The library is C++ with a set of Python bindings. Game
development with Panda3D usually consists of writing a Python or C++ program
that controls the Panda3D library.</p>
<p>Panda3D was created for commercial game development and is still used for
developing commercial games. Because of this, the engine needs to emphasize
four areas: power, speed, completeness, and error tolerance. Everyone knows
what power and speed are. But completeness and error tolerance deserve some
extra commentary.</p>
<p>Completeness means that Panda3D contains many unexciting but essential tools:
scene graph browsing, performance monitoring, animation optimizers, and so
forth.</p>
<p>Error tolerance is about the fact that all game developers create bugs. When
you do, you want your engine to give you a clear error message and help you
find the mistake. Too many engines will just crash if you pass the wrong value
to a function. Panda3D almost never crashes, and much code is dedicated to the
problem of tracking and isolating errors.</p>
<p>Finally, to come back to power and speed: to gauge Panda3D&#8217;s capabilities you
can take a look at the <a class="reference internal" href="../samples/index.html#samples"><span class="std std-ref">Sample Programs</span></a>. These are short
programs that demonstrate a sampling of Panda3D&#8217;s capabilities. The
screenshots have frame-rates in the upper-right corner, taken on a Radeon
X700. Note that some samples are old and use placeholder art and so are not
great examples of Panda3D&#8217;s visual capabilities.</p>
<p>Panda3D was developed by Disney for their massively multiplayer online game,
Toontown Online. It was released as free software in 2002. Carnegie Mellon
University&#8217;s Entertainment Technology Center, which currently hosts the
website and other Panda3D services, was actively involved in the development
of Panda3D into an open source project. It is now developed jointly by Disney
and contributors from around the world.</p>

Features</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="panda3d-is-not-a-beginner-s-tool-or-a-toy">
<h2>Panda3D is not a Beginner&#8217;s Tool or a Toy<a class="headerlink" href="#panda3d-is-not-a-beginner-s-tool-or-a-toy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To successfully use Panda3D, you must be a skilled programmer. If you do not
know what an &#8220;API&#8221; is, or if you don&#8217;t know what a &#8220;tree&#8221; is, you will
probably find Panda3D overwhelming. This is no point-and-click game-maker:
this is a tool for professionals. While it is important to point that out so
you have accurate expectations, it&#8217;s also relevant to be aware that Panda3D is
one of the easiest and most powerful engines you will ever use, and we welcome
your participation.</p>
<p>If you are just getting started with programming, we suggest that your best
option is to start with a class on programming. Alternately, you could try
teaching yourself using a training tool like <a class="reference external" href="http://alice.org">Alice</a>,
from CMU.</p>
<p>Panda3D supports the full range of what modern engines should: it provides
convenient support for normal mapping, gloss mapping, HDR, cartoon shading and
inking, bloom, and a number of other things. It also allows you to write your
own shaders.</p>
<p>People sometimes have the mistaken impression that Panda3D is written in
Python, which would make it very slow. But Panda3D is not written in Python;
it&#8217;s written in C++. Python is just used for scripting. Developers usually
write the performance-intensive bits, if any, in C++ or something similar
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.panda3d.org/blog/panda3d-and-cython/">Cython</a>. To see what
kind of framerate a small Panda3D program typically gets, take a look at the
screenshots of the <a class="reference internal" href="../samples/index.html#samples"><span class="std std-ref">Sample Programs</span></a>. Those were taken using an
old Radeon x700. Of course, only a sample program can run at 400 fps like
that, but for a real game, 60 fps is quite attainable. One caveat, though: to
get that kind of performance, you need to understand 3D cards and 3D
performance optimization. It doesn&#8217;t happen automatically. Panda3D includes
profiling tools you need to hit 60 fps.</p>

<div class="section" id="panda3d-s-software-license">
<h2>Panda3D&#8217;s Software License<a class="headerlink" href="#panda3d-s-software-license" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since version 1.5.3, Panda3D has been released under the so-called &#8220;Modified
BSD license,&#8221; which is a free software license with very few restrictions on
usage. In versions 1.5.2 and before, it used a proprietary license which was
very similar in intention to the BSD and MIT licenses, though there was some
disagreement about the freeness of two of the clauses. The old license can
still be accessed
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.panda3d.orgvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/panda3d/doc/doc/LICENSE?revision=1.1">here</a>.</p>
<p>Although the engine itself is completely free, it comes with various
third-party libraries that are not free software. Some of them (like FMOD)
even restrict you from using them in commercial games unless you have licensed
copies. Because of this reason, Panda3D makes it easy to disable or remove
these restricted third-party libraries, and most of the time it offers an
alternative. For example, it also comes with OpenAL which you can use instead
of FMOD.</p>

<div class="section" id="who-is-working-on-panda3d">
<h2>Who is Working on Panda3D<a class="headerlink" href="#who-is-working-on-panda3d" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are a number of developers in the commercial and open-source community.
Currently, besides the active contributions from the open-source community,
the most active member of the development community is Disney. Disney&#8217;s
primary interest in Panda3D is commercial. Panda3D is being used in the
development of a number of Disney games and amusement-park exhibits. To serve
Disney&#8217;s needs, Panda3D must be a fully-featured engine, capable of all the
performance and quality one expects in any &#8216;A-grade&#8217; commercial title.</p>
<p>The most supported language is Python. Though you can use C++ too, the
documentation is mostly aimed at Python use.</p>
